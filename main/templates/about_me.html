    <h2>About Me !</h2>
    <p>I am a Junior Software Engineer with a deep passion for Web Development and the AI field. My journey into Artificial Intelligence began with my final year project on smart agriculture disease detection, where I witnessed firsthand the power of AI in solving real-world problems. This experience ignited my ambition to transition into an AI Engineer, combining my expertise in software development with cutting-edge AI technologies. With a strong foundation in web development, I strive to expand my knowledge, refine my skills, and tackle new challenges. I believe that growth comes from continuous learning, and I am always ready to embrace new adventures in the tech world.</p>
